This Zend Framework project was developed as a study case of a college monograph. The main purpose is to provide a simple Zend Framework application architecture using design patterns.

# Introduction

This code provides a simple library rent application, with simple features just to provide samples of the implementation of the design patterns.

# Design Patterns

There are five design patterns implemented in the application code base:

* Data Mapper
* Table Data Gateway
* Facade
* Simple Factory
* Observer

Besides that, there are also the design patterns included in Zend Framework code itself, but that was not included in the monograph focus.
